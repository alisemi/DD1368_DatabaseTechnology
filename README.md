The database has some raw information with users and bookings and payments. 
We have created a simple database with some functional dependencies and we are testing some functions. 

Languages used are:
PHP
HTML
Mysql.

In order to make use of this model one needs to install mysql. https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/installing.html
Also, one needs to turn his computer into a server. This can be done by using apache. https://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi

If in Ubuntu, remember to have the php files in the /var/www/html folder.
